## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
List of favorite applications:
1. Instagram
    - Unsend messages
    - Upload stories
    - Change background color of messages
2. Twitter
    - Voice spaces
    - Tweets
    - Communities
3. Notion
    - Add pages
    - Create a calendar
    - Can share pages

I would like to create an app that encourage productivity in a competitive way with a leaderboard system. You can add tasks such as washing dishes and when you complete the task, you earn points that will place you somewhere on the leaderboard with your friends.
## Notes
